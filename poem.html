  <div class="poem-title">For My Bestfriend</div>

  <div class="poem-line">It all began back in sixth grade,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Two souls who somehow collided, stayed.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Zarmeen, the girl who turned my dull world bright,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Who made even silence feel light.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I still remember that day you called me your best friend,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And something inside me just… changed.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I didn’t even know a boy and girl could be that close,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">But you, you broke that thought like it was nothing.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">We laughed, we shared, we lived through tiny stories</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You knew my secrets before I did.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And for me, it wasn’t friendship anymore,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">It was peace. It was home.</div>

  <div class="poem-line">But then came the mess, the storm, the silence.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Some misunderstanding, some stupid influence,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And suddenly, we weren’t us anymore.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">The ones who couldn’t shut up turned into strangers.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You came back, Zarmeen. You said sorry.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You cried. You tried.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">But I was too cruel, too frozen, too full of ego.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You dropped your pride; I held mine tighter.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And every time you cried, I looked away.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Now when I remember, it burns</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I want to go back and slap that version of me,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Scream at him for breaking something so pure.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I treated a princess like she was nothing,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And it still haunts me every damn day.</div>

  <div class="poem-line">Days turned to months, and months to a year.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And one day I missed you, Zarmeen.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">No reason, no trigger just an ache.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And when I finally reached out,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You didn’t question, you didn’t accuse.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You just… forgave.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Without a sorry, without an explanation.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You let me back in like nothing happened,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And that’s when I realized</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You weren’t like anyone else.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">When everyone left, when fake friends turned their backs,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You were there, still explaining, still calming,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Still being my Zaruu, the one who never gave up on me.</div>

  <div class="poem-line">But life doesn’t stop testing, does it?</div>
  <div class="poem-line">The day you said, “You’re my second best friend now,”</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Something inside me broke so loud</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I swear the walls heard it.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">“Second”. Just one word</div>
  <div class="poem-line">But it stabbed like a truth I deserved.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I smiled outside, but inside I wanted to scream,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">“How did I lose you, Zaruu? How?”</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You gave me everything care, loyalty, love</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And I gave you pain and silence.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">That day, I wanted to fall on my knees,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">To touch your feet, to say sorry till my voice broke.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I would’ve done anything, anything,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">For one more chance to be your first again.</div>

  <div class="poem-line">Zarmeen, you’re not just my best friend.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You’re the mirror that showed me who I am.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You’re the calm after chaos,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">The teacher life sent wrapped as a blessing.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You’re more mature, more kind, more strong</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Than I could ever hope to be.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You held my broken pieces like they mattered,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Even when I was the one who dropped yours.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You never reminded me of my mistakes</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You just showed me what forgiveness looks like.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You’re my punishment and my peace.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">My regret and my redemption.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And I don’t deserve you but I’m still thankful you exist.</div>

  <div class="poem-line">So here’s what I swear, Zarmeen</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I’ll never let my pride speak louder than my heart again.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I’ll protect this bond like it’s sacred,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Because it is. You are.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I’ll earn back every bit of trust I broke,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">Even if it takes forever.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You’re not my “best friend” anymore</div>
  <div class="poem-line">You’re my constant, my reminder, my lesson.</div>
  <div class="poem-line">And if God ever asked me what I want back in life,</div>
  <div class="poem-line">I’d say one thing</div>
  <div class="poem-line">“Give me Zaruu again… and this time, I won’t let her go.”</div>
